<p><span>Online Payments can be done by:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Credit Card&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Debit Card</span></li>
<li><span>Net banking</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>There are no hidden charges. You pay only the amount that you see in your order summary at the time of check out.</span></p>
<p><span>If you see any charges on your credit/debit card for purchases made but you have never created an account or signed up, please check with your family members or business colleagues authorized to make purchases on your behalf. If you're still unable to recognize the charge, please report the unauthorized purchase within 30 days of the transaction so that we can look into it.</span></p>
<p><span>In case of a payment failure, please retry ensuring information passed on to payment gateway is accurate, i.e. account details, billing address, password (for net banking), etc.&nbsp; Kindly also check if your internet connection has been disrupted in the process.</span></p>
<p><span>If your account has been debited after a payment failure, it is normally rolled back to your account within 7 business days.</span></p>
