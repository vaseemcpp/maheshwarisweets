          You as a customer can cancel your order anytime up to the cut-off time of the slot, i.e, within 24 hours of placing the order. In such a case we will refund any payments already made by you for the order.
          <br />
          <br />
          We cannot accept any cancellations once the order is dispatched. We do not accept any returns once the order is delivered for safety and hygiene reasons as the products are eatables.

          If we suspect any fraudulent transaction by any customer or any transaction which defies the terms & conditions of using the website, we at our sole discretion can cancel such orders. We will maintain a negative list of all fraudulent transactions and customers and would deny access to them or cancel any orders placed by them.
